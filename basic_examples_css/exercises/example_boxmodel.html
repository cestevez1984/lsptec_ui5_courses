    Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie (September 9, 1941 â€“ c. October 12, 2011) was an American computer
    scientist.[1] He created the C programming language and, with long-time colleague Ken Thompson,
    the Unix operating system and B programming language.[1] Ritchie and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Thompson</a> were awarded the
    Turing Award from the ACM in 1983, the Hamming Medal from the IEEE in 1990 and the National
    Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton in 1999. Ritchie was the head of Lucent Technologies
    System Software Research Department
    when he retired in 2007. He was the "R" in K&R C, and commonly known by his username dmr.
